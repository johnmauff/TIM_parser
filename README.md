This contains the development version of a C++-based code that will parse the MOM6 configuration files.  This repo contains source, a Makefile, several test MOM6 input files, and a submodule for PEGTL (https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL.git).   In order to check this out and build type the command 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/johnmauff/TIM_parser
The test code can be built using make.
